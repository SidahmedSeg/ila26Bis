# Bun Runtime Solution for Prisma + NestJS

## Problem
- Prisma client generated by Bun is in `node_modules/.bun/@prisma+client@...`
- Node.js can't find Prisma client at runtime
- Controllers depending on Prisma fail to register

## Solution: Use Bun Runtime

Since Prisma client is generated by Bun, we should use Bun to run the application as well.

## Changes Made

1. ✅ Updated `package.json` start scripts to use `bun dist/main.js` instead of `node dist/main.js`
2. ✅ Tested Prisma client availability with Bun - ✅ Works!
3. ✅ Running NestJS app with Bun runtime

## Benefits

- ✅ Prisma client path compatibility - Bun knows where it generated the client
- ✅ Faster startup - Bun is faster than Node.js
- ✅ Consistent runtime - Same tool for generation and execution
- ✅ Better TypeScript support - Bun has native TypeScript support

## Verification

Test with:
```bash
cd apps/api
bun dist/main.js
```

Then test routes:
- `GET /health` - Should work
- `POST /auth/send-otp` - Should now work!

## Note

NestJS works perfectly with Bun. The issue was the runtime mismatch (Bun generates Prisma, Node.js runs app).
